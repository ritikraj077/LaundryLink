Creating a laundry booking system for a university involves managing laundry machines, booking slots, user authentication, and possibly payment integration. Here's a simplified outline of how you could structure such a system:

> User Authentication:

Students, faculty, and staff members should be able to register and log in to the system.
Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.
Implement roles (e.g., student, staff, admin) to control access to different features.
> Laundry Machines Management:

Maintain a list of laundry machines available on campus.
Include details such as machine type (washer/dryer), location, availability, and status (e.g., working, out of order).
> Booking Management:

Users should be able to view available time slots for each machine.
Allow users to book a specific machine for a selected time slot.
Implement features like automatic slot assignment or manual selection based on availability.
Consider implementing limits on how far in advance users can book slots to ensure fairness.
> Notification System:

Send email or push notifications to users to confirm their bookings, remind them before their scheduled time, and notify them of any changes or cancellations.
Notify users when their laundry cycle is complete, especially if there's a shared laundry area where they might not be present.
> Admin Panel:

> Provide administrators with tools to manage laundry machines, view booking statistics, and handle reported issues (e.g., broken machines).
Admins should be able to add/remove machines, adjust availability, and view usage analytics.
Payment Integration (Optional):

If your university charges for laundry services, integrate a payment gateway for users to pay for their bookings.
Keep track of payments and provide receipts or invoices to users.
> Frontend Interface:

Create a user-friendly web interface for students and staff to view available machines, book slots, and manage their bookings.
Design an intuitive dashboard where users can easily navigate through the available options and manage their laundry schedule.
> Accessibility Features:

Ensure your system is accessible to users with disabilities, including those who may rely on screen readers or keyboard navigation.
Provide alternative text for images, ensure proper color contrast, and make sure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.
Data Privacy and Security:

Implement measures to protect user data and ensure compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR).
Encrypt sensitive information such as passwords and personal details.
Regularly audit your system for security vulnerabilities and apply updates as needed.
